"South freezes the state of the ORM and models whenever you do a migration, "
"meaning that when your migrations run in the future, they see the models and "
"fields they're expecting (the ones that were around when they were created), "
"rather than the current set (which could be months or even years newer)."

"South doesn't freeze every aspect of a model; for example, it doesn't "
