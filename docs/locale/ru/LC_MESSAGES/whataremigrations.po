"For the uninitiated, migrations (also known as 'schema evolution' or "
"'mutations') are a way of changing your database schema from one version "
"into another. Django by itself can only do this by adding new models, but "
"nearly all projects will find themselves changing other aspects of models - "
"be it adding a new field to a model, or changing a database column to have "
"null=True."

"South, and other solutions, provide a way of getting round this by giving "
"you the tools to easily and predictably upgrade your database schema. You "
"write migrations, which tell South how to upgrade from one version to the "
"next, and by stringing these migrations together you can move forwards (or "
"backwards) through the history of your database schema."

"In South, the migrations also form the way of creating your database "
"initially - the first migration simply migrates from an empty schema to your "
"first tables. This way, running through all the migrations brings your "
"database up-to-date with the most current version of the app, and if you "
"already have an older version, you simply need to run through the ones that "
"appeared since last time."
