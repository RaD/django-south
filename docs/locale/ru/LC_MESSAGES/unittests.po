"default when you run ``./manage.py test``. This is mainly because the test "
"suite is meant to be run in isolation (the test framework continually "
"changes ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and fiddles with the ORM as it runs, among other "
"things), and can cause compatability problems with other applications."
