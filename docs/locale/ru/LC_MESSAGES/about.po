"We try to make South both as easy-to-use and intuitive as possible, by "
"making it automate most of your schema-changing tasks, while at the same "
"time providing a powerful set of tools for large or complex projects; you "
"can easily write your own migrations by hand, or even use the database "
"altering API directly."

"South was originally developed at `Torchbox <http://www.torchbox.com>`_ in "
"2008, when no existing solution provided the workflow and features that were "
"needed. It was open-sourced shortly thereafter, and quickly gained steam "
"after the Schema Evolution panel at DjangoCon 2008."

"Sometime in 2009, it became the most popular of the various migration "
"alternatives, and seems to have been going strong ever since. While there "
"have been growing calls to integrate South, or something like it, into "
"Django itself, such an integration has not yet been made, mostly due to the "
"relative immaturity of database migration solutions."
