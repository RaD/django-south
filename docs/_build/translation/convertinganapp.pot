msgid "The convert_to_south command only works entirely on the first machine you run it on. Once you've committed the initial migrations it made into your VCS, you'll have to run ``./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake`` on every machine that has a copy of the codebase (make sure they were up-to-date with models and schema first)."
