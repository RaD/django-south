msgid "We try to make South both as easy-to-use and intuitive as possible, by making it automate most of your schema-changing tasks, while at the same time providing a powerful set of tools for large or complex projects; you can easily write your own migrations by hand, or even use the database altering API directly."

msgid "South was originally developed at `Torchbox <http://www.torchbox.com>`_ in 2008, when no existing solution provided the workflow and features that were needed. It was open-sourced shortly thereafter, and quickly gained steam after the Schema Evolution panel at DjangoCon 2008."

msgid "Sometime in 2009, it became the most popular of the various migration alternatives, and seems to have been going strong ever since. While there have been growing calls to integrate South, or something like it, into Django itself, such an integration has not yet been made, mostly due to the relative immaturity of database migration solutions."
